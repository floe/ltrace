/* There are two PLT types on 32-bit PPC: old-style, BSS PLT, and
 * new-style "secure" PLT.  We can tell one from the other by the
 * flags on the .plt section.  If it's +X (executable), it's BSS PLT,
 * otherwise it's secure.
 *
 * BSS PLT works the same way as most architectures: the .plt section
 * contains trampolines and we put breakpoints to those.  If not
 * prelinked, .plt contains zeroes, and dynamic linker fills in the
 * initial set of trampolines, which means that we need to delay
 * enabling breakpoints until after binary entry point is hit.
 * Additionally, after first call, dynamic linker updates .plt with
 * branch to resolved address.  That means that on first hit, we must
 * do something similar to the PPC64 gambit described below.
 *
 * With secure PLT, the .plt section doesn't contain instructions but
 * addresses.  The real PLT table is stored in .text.  Addresses of
 * those PLT entries can be computed, and apart from the fact that
 * they are in .text, they are ordinary PLT entries.
 *
 * 64-bit PPC is more involved.  Program linker creates for each
 * library call a _stub_ symbol named xxxxxxxx.plt_call.<callee>
 * (where xxxxxxxx is a hexadecimal number).  That stub does the call
 * dispatch: it loads an address of a function to call from the
 * section .plt, and branches.  PLT entries themselves are essentially
 * a curried call to the resolver.  When the symbol is resolved, the
 * resolver updates the value stored in .plt, and the next time
 * around, the stub calls the library function directly.  So we make
 * at most one trip (none if the binary is prelinked) through each PLT
 * entry, and correspondingly that is useless as a breakpoint site.
 *
 * Note the three confusing terms: stubs (that play the role of PLT
 * entries), PLT entries, .plt section.
 *
 * We first check symbol tables and see if we happen to have stub
 * symbols available.  If yes we just put breakpoints to those, and
 * treat them as usual breakpoints.  The only tricky part is realizing
 * that there can be more than one breakpoint per symbol.
 *
 * The case that we don't have the stub symbols available is harder.
 * The following scheme uses two kinds of PLT breakpoints: unresolved
 * and resolved (to some address).  When the process starts (or when
 * we attach), we distribute unresolved PLT breakpoints to the PLT
 * entries (not stubs).  Then we look in .plt, and for each entry
 * whose value is different than the corresponding PLT entry address,
 * we assume it was already resolved, and convert the breakpoint to
 * resolved.  We also rewrite the resolved value in .plt back to the
 * PLT address.
 *
 * When a PLT entry hits a resolved breakpoint (which happens because
 * we rewrite .plt with the original unresolved addresses), we move
 * the instruction pointer to the corresponding address and continue
 * the process as if nothing happened.
 *
 * When unresolved PLT entry is called for the first time, we need to
 * catch the new value that the resolver will write to a .plt slot.
 * We also need to prevent another thread from racing through and
 * taking the branch without ltrace noticing.  So when unresolved PLT
 * entry hits, we have to stop all threads.  We then single-step
 * through the resolver, until the .plt slot changes.  When it does,
 * we treat it the same way as above: convert the PLT breakpoint to
 * resolved, and rewrite the .plt value back to PLT address.  We then
 * start all threads again.
 *
 * As an optimization, we remember the address where the address was
 * resolved, and put a breakpoint there.  The next time around (when
 * the next PLT entry is to be resolved), instead of single-stepping
 * through half the dynamic linker, we just let the thread run and hit
 * this breakpoint.  When it hits, we know the PLT entry was resolved.
 *
 * XXX TODO If we have hardware watch point, we might put a read watch
 * on .plt slot, and discover the offenders this way.  I don't know
 * the details, but I assume at most a handful (like, one or two, if
 * available at all) addresses may be watched at a time, and thus this
 * would be used as an amendment of the above rather than full-on
 * solution to PLT tracing on PPC.

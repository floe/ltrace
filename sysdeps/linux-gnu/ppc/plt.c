	// address even.  Ater the PLT has been initialized, but before it has
	// been resolved, the first word will be the address of the function in
	// the dynamic linker that will reslove the PLT.  After the PLT is
	// resolved, this will will be the address of the routine whose symbol
	// is in the symbol table.

	// On a PowerPC-32 system, there are two types of PLTs: secure (new) and
	// non-secure (old).  For the secure case, the PLT is simply a pointer
	// and we can treat it much as we do for the PowerPC-64 case.  For the
	// non-secure case, the PLT is executable code and we can put the
	// break-point right in the PLT.

#ifndef BREAKPOINT_H
#define BREAKPOINT_H

/* XXX This is currently a very weak abstraction.  We would like to
 * much expand this to allow things like breakpoints on SDT probes and
 * such.
 *
 * In particular, we would like to add a tracepoint abstraction.
 * Tracepoint is a traceable feature--e.g. an exact address, a DWARF
 * symbol, an ELF symbol, a PLT entry, or an SDT probe.  Tracepoints
 * are named and the user can configure which of them he wants to
 * enable.  Realized tracepoints enable breakpoints, which are a
 * low-level realization of high-level tracepoint.
 *
 * Service breakpoints like the handling of dlopen would be a
 * low-level breakpoint, likely without tracepoint attached.
 *
 * So that's for sometimes.
